## Git Basics

Code previews can be done with the help backtics, three of them before the "code" and three after. Backticks => ```

```
git add
```

Git add will tell git to start tracking the changes, and prepare it for commit. 

```
git commit
```

Takes a snapshot of our changes and saves it as a version of our code. Makes it possible to go back to previous versions of the code if we have to.

```
git status
```

Checks the status of the files that have been changed or not changed.

```
git log
```

Gives you a list of the recent commit history.
